# B2B Ecommerce Platform b/w Vendors and Retailers
This is a B2B ecommerce platform that connects vendors and retailers.

## The Problem
We’re not giving you a fixed problem statement. What you have is a broad, open-ended challenge:
**“In India, street food vendors have a problem with bringing in raw materials from trusted and cheap vendors.”**
Explore this ecosystem. Think about how vendors operate, where they face pain, how the supply chain works, and how trust plays a role. Talk to real people, observe, question, validate.
Your task is to pick a specific angle of this issue and build a web-based digital solution that solves it.

## **Example Scenario**
Let’s say the broad problem is
**“Street food vendors struggle to find affordable raw materials.”**
Bad solution: A basic website saying "Buy cheap materials here" with no actual sourcing system.
Good solution: A web app where vendors can search verified suppliers nearby, compare prices, place group orders, or even track delivery.
*Note: this example is just for understanding. Do not use this idea as a solution, otherwise no evaluation will be done.*

## **Design Guidelines**
You can use any design system or style you are comfortable with. It can be Material, iOS, Shadcn or your own setup. Just make sure it is clean, easy to follow and not confusing. Do not overload the screen. Use simple patterns that anyone can understand.
